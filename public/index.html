            <p>My name is Aimar, a year 2 student pursuing a Bsc in Computer Science. My mission is not yet defined, but I think education, access to opportunities and unemployment are major issues on our continent and I would love to take on that challenge.
                I am passionate individual, I love reading and writting, tech and especially AI, Animals, politics and entrepreneurship.</p><p>My two favorite quotes are "You can choose a life of comfort and ease, or you can choose a life of service and adventure. When you are 80, you'll be proud of the latter" by Jeff Bezos, and "And, when you want something, the universe conspires in helping you achieve it" By Paulo Coelho in The Alchemist.
        </p><p>I am self-taught in machine learning, and I recently started my first entrepreneurial venture. Feel free to scroll through my page to learn more about me and don't hesitate to reach out if you want to talk about anything!</p>
